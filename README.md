# CTB Verification Hackathon 2022
The hackathon provides a basic hands-on for design verification, which enhances practical verification knowledge.

This Hackathon is organized by NIELIT  Calicut and technically facilitated by  Vyoma Systems , VLSI System Design & Robotics and Automation Society, IEEE Kerala Section.

The program is supported  by the Chips to Startup (C2S) Program of the Govt of India and Mentored by IIT Madras.

The following designs were worked upon during the hackathon

## Level1_design1 - Multiplexer
The design implements a bugy multiplexer design which is verified.
The design is available here: [Level1_design1](./level1_design1/)

## Level1_design2 - Sequence Detector
The design implements a sequence Detector which can be used to detect a sequence of 1011 in the series of input.
The design is available here : [Level1_design2](./level1_design2/)

## Level2_design - Bitmanipulation Coprocessor
The design performs bitmanipulation on the given input operands based on the instruction given to the design.
The design is available here: [Level2_design](./level2_design/)

## Level3_design - Simple Processor
The design features a simple Computer design. A bug is introduced and is exposed using the procedure of verification.
The design is available here: [Level3_design](./level3_design/)

## Report
The Report for the final design is available here:
